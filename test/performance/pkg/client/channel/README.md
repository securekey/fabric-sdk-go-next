#Benchmark testing of Channel Client
    This benchmark test has 1 valid call of Channel Client's Execute() function
    
    Under the directory where this file resides, the test commands are run as shown under the below comments: 
	(
	    * on a Macbook Pro, warning messages are stripped out below for conciseness
	    * Benchmark is using Go's test command with -bench=ExecuteTx
	    * the -run=notest flag means execute a non-existant 'notest' in the current folder
	        This will avoid running normal unit tests along with the benchmarks
	    * by default, the benchmark tool decides when it collected enough information and stops
	    * the use of -benchtime=XXs forces the benchmark to keep executing until this time has elapsed
	        This allows the tool to run for longer times and collect more accurate information for larger execution loads
	    * the benchmark output format is as follows:
	        benchmarkname           [logs from benchamark tests-They have removed from the example commands below]   NbOfOperationExecutions     TimeInNanoSeconds/OperationExecuted   MemoryAllocated/OperationExecuted    NbOfAllocations/OperationExecuted  
	        Example from below commands:
	        BenchmarkExecuteTx-8    [logs removed]                                                                   100000                      164854 ns/op                          5743056 B/op                         50449 allocs/op 
	        
	    * the command output also shows the environment and the package used for the benchmark exection:
	        goos: darwin
            goarch: amd64
            pkg: github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/test/performance/pkg/client/channel
            
        UPDATE: there are now 2 benchmarks in this file, the first being the original one which runs with sequential executions and the second makes use of
        parallel client executions to simulate simultanous calls from the client (command line outputs below are updated to reflect these two calls). 
            - To run the parallel test use -bench=ExecuteTxParallel
            - to run all benchmarks use -bench=* or -bench=ExecuteTx*
            
        NOTE: Since the peers/orderers are mocked and running in the same process as the benchmark's, the perf data for this benchmark includes info for both 
        the benchmark and the mocked servers which decreases the overall performance results. To get exact performance data for this channel client of the Go SDK, 
        one needs to run benchmarks against a real Fabric network with peers and orderers running in Docker containers.
        
        Final Note: Performance collection using the Tally performance tool (see section below) now requires the SDK to be built with the pprof tag.
        This means in order to collect Tally data via the Prometheus report, the below sample commands were updated to include `-tags pprof`

#Benchmark data in Tally (using Prometheus report)
The Channel Client's Execute and Query functions have been amended to collect tally counts and time spent executing these functions.

In order to support collecting the data, make sure to start the data collector server found in:
fabric-sdk-go/test/performance/metrics/server.go

example of starting a data collector server is found in this benchmark (reference initAndStartMetricsServer() call)

then start the Prometheus Docker container (an example docker compose config file is found at:
fabric-sdk-go/test/performance/prometheus
)

finally run your sdk client and the perf data will be collected by the prometheus server. Navigate to 
127.0.0.1:9095
to view the report. 

Make sure the Go client is running and some channel communication activity has occured with a peer in order 
to see collected performance data.


for the purpose of this channel client benchmark, once the Prometheus docker container is started, run the benchmark with long enough
run times and navigate to the address above to see data being collected 
(run with -benchtime=300s will show this data on the report as an example)

If you would like to collect perf data into your version of Prometheus server (example dedicated performance environment),
make sure to add metrics calls using the 'metrics' packgage in this sdk
ie: "github.com/hyperledger/fabric-sdk-go/test/performance/metrics"

for an example usage on how to setup data collection in your client application, see: fabric-sdk-go/pkg/client/channel/chclient.go

#Benchmark CPU & Memory performance analysis
    In order to generate profiling data for the chClient benchmark, the go test command can be extended to generate these.
    Note: If the below command complains about cpu.out or mem.out files are missing, create these files with empty content
     prior to running the command:
    
go test -v -run=notest -bench=ExecuteTx -benchtime=1s -outputdir ./bench1s -cpuprofile cpu.out -memprofilerate 1 -memprofile mem.out

    once ./bench1s has a valid cpu.out and mem.out content, then we can use go pprof command to examine the perf data.
    
    The above command will also generate the go binary file from which the profiling data is generated (benchmark.test).
    
    
    * For CPU perf data analysis:
go tool pprof benchmark.test ./bench1s/cpu.out 

    * For Memory - allocation data analysis (count by number of allocation):
go tool pprof --inuse_objects benchmark.test ./bench1s/mem.out 

    * For Memory - total allocation data analysis:
go tool pprof --alloc_space benchmark.test ./bench1s/mem.out
